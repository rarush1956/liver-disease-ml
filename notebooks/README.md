# Jupyter Notebooks – Liver Disease Prediction

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory analysis,
model experimentation, and result visualization for the liver disease
prediction project.

The notebooks are intended for understanding the data, comparing machine
learning models, and validating the final pipeline used in the main
implementation.

## Notebook Description

### `liver_disease_model.ipynb`

This notebook includes the complete experimental workflow:

- Loading and inspecting the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling using standardization
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE oversampling
- Training and comparing multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Interpreting results and identifying key predictive features

The notebook was primarily used during the research and development
phase before finalizing the model architecture.

---

## Purpose of Notebooks

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques
- Compare baseline and advanced machine learning models
- Generate visualizations used in the research paper
- Validate assumptions before final model selection

---

## Notes

- The final model implementation is available in the `src/` directory
- Figures generated from notebooks are saved in the `figures/` folder
- The notebook is designed for reproducibility and clarity
